          <section class="content"><p>Choosing appropriate data storage is one of the first and most important
decisions you have to face once you&#39;ve started implementing an application
(at least in web or mobile world). There are lots of possibilities out
there, <span class="caps">SQL</span> and NoSQL, documents and objects and graphs and tables and
whatnot. But I want to talk about those cases, when a fully-featured
database for storing your data may be either not enough or too much.
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>To be clear, by database I mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"><span class="caps">DBMS</span></a> or database management
system, and by data storage I mean any organized representation of your&nbsp;data.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">RAM</span></h2>
<p>That&#39;s pretty obvious. You need to store non-critical data and have fast
access to it &mdash; use <span class="caps">RAM</span>. Classical use cases&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mock storage for unit&nbsp;tests</p>
<p>Instead of running your tests using real database, sometimes it&#39;s
easier to mock storage using some build-in collections like lists,
dictionaries (aka maps)&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>It forces you to write database-agnostic code, isolate storage
interaction and concentrate on application logic. Which is a good
thing,&nbsp;obviously.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a simple mock in&nbsp;javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    <span class="keyword">var</span> users = {}; <span class="comment">// fill this with mock data</span>

    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">getUserById</span><span class="params">(id)</span> {</span>
      <span class="keyword">return</span> users[id];
    }</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Cache</p>
<p>Instead of reading often used data from disk all the time, cache it in
memory! It is fast and nothing inevitable can happen once your app
unexpectedly shut&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>I use it a lot. In the most recent project, I&#39;ve been working on, all
the vital data gets loaded into cache in <span class="caps">RAM</span> on application start up
and is updated in cache first, before any changes get stored to&nbsp;disk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pre-aggregation</p>
<p>Suppose you need to track page views on popular site&hellip; all of
them. That&#39;s a lot of data. Writing each page view to disk real-time
will certainly lead to performance&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>It is possible to improve performance by storing data in <span class="caps">RAM</span> first,
and flushing it to disk every now and then. To optimize even more in
case you need to track just certain parameters (e.g. User-Agent),
pre-aggregate data based on those and then flush&nbsp;it:</p>
<pre><code>Chrome    300 visits
Firefox   220 visits</code></pre>
<p>There is a chance of losing data, while it is not on the disk. That&#39;s
a price you have to pay for performance. Think about how much data you
can afford to loose and tweak <em>period in which flushing occurs</em>&nbsp;accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="http://heymoose.com/">Heymoose</a>, advertising platform I was working on,
uses this tactics to store ad shows and&nbsp;clicks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are more possible use cases. The general idea is: “If
you want to keep things simple and you&#39;re not afraid to loose data up
to some point, <span class="caps">RAM</span> is a great easy-to-use storage available out of (your
favourite language)&nbsp;box.”</p>
<h2>Files</h2>
<p>This is <em>the most underestimated storage</em> in web development of all time.
I think it all began with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)"><span class="caps">LAMP</span></a>. <em>MySQL</em> became a minimum
requirement for building a website, thus the simplest, fastest and
sometimes even more reliable storage&nbsp;forgotten&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Plain-text files</em> can be used for lots of stuff, although there are
certain use cases, when they are simply the best fit for the&nbsp;job:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Log-like&nbsp;data</p>
<p>Access logs, error logs, debug logs &mdash; this is a huge amount of
important data. Applications do not tend to use <em><span class="caps">DBMS</span></em> for this. It&#39;s
simpler and faster to write to files.  And, most importantly, it
<em>reduces the number of levels of complexity</em>.</p>
<p>In the past I was working on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange"><span class="caps">FIX</span></a> traffic analyser tool. The
low level part of this project was written in C and was responsible
for capturing and writing <span class="caps">FIX</span> messages into rotated log. High level
part was providing a fancy web interface for searching and analyzing
those&nbsp;messages.</p>
<p>Amount of data was huge, <span class="caps">DBMS</span> would require lots of resources to
handle it. With files (in conjunction with with pre-aggregation) it
became&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Indexing and searching through this data was implemented with
<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a>. It all worked like a&nbsp;charm!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Replacement for a database with a simple&nbsp;structure</p>
<p>For prototypes, tests or even working apps, it is possible to use
files to store your data like you would use a&nbsp;database:</p>
<pre><code>db
├── painters
│   ├── k.malevich@square.io.json
│   ├── r.falk@msk.ru.json
│   └── v.kandinsky@circles.ru.json
└── paintings
    ├── black-square.json
    ├── moscow-I.json
    └── portrait-of-a-tatar-journalist-midhat-refatov.json</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with files in high-level languages is fun and easy. Considering
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache">caching</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll">epoll</a> and other cool options, it can also
be very efficient and&nbsp;convenient.</p>
<h2>To&nbsp;summarize</h2>
<p>Storing your data is not only about MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc. Very
often compound solutions may lead to cleaner code, higher performance and
flexibility. And sometimes you don&#39;t even need fully-featured <span class="caps">DBMS</span> at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Use programs that do one thing and do it well. Use programs to work&nbsp;together.</p>
