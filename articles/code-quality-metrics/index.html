          <section class="content"><p>Every programmer instantly measures quality of code, whether it is his
(her/their?) own masterpiece, or some crap written by some other guy. And
there are lots of metrics defined by smart people out there, that help you
in this
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29">cohesion</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">code coverage</a>,
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">WTFs/minute</a>). Well, I‘m no
exception, and just recently I’ve started to think about what am I paying
attention to in the first place.  <span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Turned out, there are just two things, that bother me most of the time:
<strong>complexity</strong> and <strong>duplication</strong>. This is all I need to tell whether code
I‘m looking at is worth something.. And that’s what <strong><span class="caps">DRY</span></strong> (don&#39;t repeat
yourself) and <strong><span class="caps">KISS</span></strong> (keep it super simple) are&nbsp;about.</p>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p><em>Writing software is hard!</em> You have to joggle all this abstract concepts,
think about what library to use and how efficient your code is and so on.
Years spent doing this made me come to a simple&nbsp;conclusion:</p>
<p>I am not that&nbsp;smart.</p>
<p>There are people that can handle it much better than me. They can keep in
mind <em>stack traces 200 calls long</em>, name you all <em>70 functions</em> of a module
in alphabetical order and tell what is that <em>100 lines of code block</em> doing
just by looking at it for 5&nbsp;secs.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t. This things matter to&nbsp;me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actual size of code Number of levels of abstraction Number of&nbsp;condition</li>
<li>operators Presence of naming conventions Number of third party&nbsp;libraries</li>
<li>used A lot&nbsp;more..</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at code I ask&nbsp;myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the purpose of this function/method/class obvious and <em>unambiguous</em>?</p>
<p>Or should I change its name, signature, remove it, break into several
smaller peaces, or merge into greater meaningful&nbsp;peace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is this level of abstraction necessary? <em>Does it remove any&nbsp;duplication?</em></p>
<p>Introducing unnecessary abstractions is, sadly, one of the most favourite
activities of contemporary programmer. Too many abstractions make code
harder to understand, debug and …yeah… change. So <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/880/stop-writing-classes">use functions
instead of classes</a>,
lightweight frameworks instead of huge <code>MV(\w*)C</code> beasts, and no ORMs,
<em>please</em>!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is it absolutely inevitably to use inheritance? In most cases it adds
incredible amount of&nbsp;complexity.</p>
<p>Should I use composition? Oh look, they even got
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">wikipedia</a>
article for&nbsp;this..</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do I <em>need</em> this third party library&nbsp;here?</p>
<p>First answer should be <em><span class="caps">NO</span></em>, cause everyone working with this code will
also need to understand how this library works and foreign code may
introduce subtle bugs and/or performance&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>Won&#39;t it be easier to write something using just standard libs&nbsp;first?</p>
<p>If I‘m absolutely sure, I will look through its source and check if it’s
still actively supported by community before adding this library to the&nbsp;project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">“Simple made easy” by Rich
Hickey</a> is a great
source of inspiration for me when it comes to complexity in software. I
strongly recommend watching it, regardless of your opinion about <em>Closure</em>.</p>
<h2>Duplication</h2>
<p>Although it seems superficial, <em>code duplication</em>, in my opinion, is a
fundamental problem in software engineering. All this complex concepts, such
as design patterns and programming paradigms serve just one purpose - remove
duplication from code. That&#39;s it. <em>It is that&nbsp;simple!</em></p>
<p>Same or <em>roughly similar</em> code in several different places is bad. You have
to keep in mind all these peaces and change them simultaneously. Well…
you&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>I began to realize this mostly after reading some of the books on <span class="caps">TDD</span> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a>, which I again strongly&nbsp;recommend.</p>
<p>Interesting thing is that there is <em>only one way</em> to solve this problem of
similar code. And that is complicating things. <em>What an&nbsp;irony!</em></p>
<p>Think about&nbsp;it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once I see a duplication (aka <em>reusable behavior</em>), I abstract it in a
class or function or module or even whole abstraction&nbsp;layer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instead of writing my own implementation of http-protocol (<em>duplicating
something somebody else wrote</em>) every time I develop a webapp, I simply
use a third-party&nbsp;library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tradeoff</h2>
<p>All I am saying is that without oversimplifying things, <strong>complexity</strong>
and <strong>duplication</strong> are all I really care about in&nbsp;programming.</p>
<p>Like most things in the industry, you need to find a tradeoff between those
two. Removing duplication leads to increasing complexity and vice versa.
Depending on situation, project, time-performance-[other] constrains I
prefer one over another. Sometimes I make a decision, that implies some
duplication, and only if it keeps bothering me, I refactor it later. It&#39;s
important that <strong>common sense plays the main role in&nbsp;it!</strong></p>
<pre><code>“All theory is gray, my friend. But forever green is the tree of life.”</code></pre>
<p>That‘s why I’m going to write about some cases, where I apply this two
criterions, in future&nbsp;posts.</p>
<p>Till&nbsp;then!</p>
