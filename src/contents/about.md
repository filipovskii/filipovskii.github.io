I am yet another *software engineer*, who likes to ship as fast as
possible, beautiful code and challenging tasks.

Look, here I am on [github][1], [twitter][2] and [linkedin][3].

Thanks for stopping by! [Mail me][4], if you ought to.

All characters and events in this work – even those based on real people –
are entirely fictional.
